## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an anime enthusiast with a Crunchyroll subscription, I want to discover anime content with enriched metadata from multiple sources, view detailed information about each series, and stream episodes directly using my existing Crunchyroll credentials, so that I can enjoy a richer viewing experience without managing multiple subscriptions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an anonymous user browsing the platform, **When** I search for "SPY x FAMILY", **Then** I see search results with the correct series including its poster, title, and IMDb rating
2. **Given** I am viewing the SPY x FAMILY series page, **When** I click "Play" on Episode 1 without being logged in, **Then** I am prompted to log in with my Crunchyroll credentials
3. **Given** I am on the login page, **When** I enter valid Crunchyroll credentials, **Then** I am successfully authenticated and can access streaming content
4. **Given** I am logged in and viewing an episode list, **When** I click "Play" on any episode, **Then** the video starts streaming within 4 seconds
5. **Given** I am watching a video, **When** I use the player controls, **Then** I can pause, adjust volume, and enter fullscreen mode
6. **Given** I am on any series page, **When** I view the IP Hub interface, **Then** I see disabled tabs for Manga, Community, and Store features indicating future functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Crunchyroll credentials are invalid? System displays "Invalid username or password" error message
- How does system handle when a series has no IMDb match? Display series without IMDb rating section
- What happens when user loses internet connection during streaming? Video player shows connection error and allows retry
- How does system handle searches with no results? Display "No results found" message with suggestions
