## Validation Criteria

Each research task is complete when:
1. Specific question is answered with code example
2. Integration approach is documented
3. Performance impact is measured
4. Error cases are identified
5. Testing strategy is defined

## Research Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical Path (RT-001, RT-003, RT-004)
Must complete before starting implementation - blocks core functionality

### Phase 2: Performance Critical (RT-002, RT-005, RT-009)
Must complete before frontend implementation - affects user experience

### Phase 3: Security & Reliability (RT-006, RT-007, RT-010)
Must complete before middleware implementation - affects system integrity

### Phase 4: Enhancements (RT-008)
Can be deferred to polish phase - nice-to-have features
